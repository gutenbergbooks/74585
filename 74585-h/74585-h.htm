</div>

<p>The Routes in this Volume have been arranged according to the
Chapters in Vol. I.</p>

<p>Additional matter is given in the shape of an Appendix,
describing the main Routes leading out of the Sudan.</p>

<p>Almost the whole Volume has been edited by Captain H. H. S.
Morant (Assistant Director of Intelligence), to whom my best thanks
are due; Captain W. Lloyd is chiefly responsible for the excellent
Routes in Kordofan.</p>

<p>Intermediate places where water is to be found (except those
obviously on a river) are given in italics.</p>

<p>[It being impossible to provide a map showing even all the
terminal places mentioned, intending travellers are referred to the
map at the <a href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74584/74584-h/74584-h.htm#map2">end
of Vol. I,</a> and to the Sudan Ordnance Survey Maps (scale,
1:250,000), a list of which is given in Vol. I, <a href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74584/74584-h/74584-h.htm#Page_349">
p. 349.</a>]</p>

<p>A certain number of copies of each Chapter in this Volume have
been printed and bound separately in strong paper covers for
practical use when travelling. Application in Egypt should be made
to the Director of Intelligence, Egyptian War Office, Cairo, or to
any Bookseller in Great Britain, of whom copies may be obtained,
price One Shilling each.</p>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot,
R.E., December</span>, 1902.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General.</span>The road described below
is only one of several that might have been taken, but I believe it
is perhaps the most direct. The portions between No. 6 and Murrat,
and along the Wadi Alagi must be common to all routes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Nature of road.</span>There are no
gradients on the road sufficiently steep to form a serious obstacle
to laden camels, but there are a good many places after the Wadi
Abu Bard is left, where the stony nature of the road is trying for
the feet of plains camels, though the camels of the country seem to
make nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>Water is scarce and not
always good. If marching with hamla,<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> arrangements should be made
to carry at least two nights’ water.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fuel and shade.</span>Once the W. Telat
Abda has been reached, fuel and shade can always be obtained with
very little management. Till then there is practically no shade. No
fuel between No. 6 and Murrat; a little between Murrat and W. Telat
Abda.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grain.</span>No grain is obtainable.
Sheep and goats and some milk can be obtained wherever Arabs are
met with. The position of the Arabs and their flocks depends on the
season of the year, and the distribution of the previous year’s
rainfall.</p>

<h3><a id="route2"></a>2.—SUAKIN <span class="sc">to</span>
BERBER.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>There are two main routes
between Suakin and Berber, both joining at Obak. The first,
<em>viâ</em> Tambuk—Dissibil—Kokreb—Ariab and Obak, the most
northerly of the two, is the usual caravan route. Major Prout
(1877) states that “this route is quite practicable for wagons, the
greater part of it being indeed an admirable road for wheels; some
difficulty would, however, be found in getting wagons over the
passes of Hareitri and Kokreb, and the dunes of Obak. At these
three points some work, not much, but rather expensive, would have
to be done to make the route a good wagon road.” The chief
difficulty lies in the arid stretch of 114 miles between Ariab and
Berber, for which Obak, lying about halfway, provides the only
water.</p>

<p>The second route, <em>viâ</em> Sinkat—Hormareb—Amet—Rowaya and
Obak is 5 or 6 miles shorter, but not so well known. It is
occasionally used by caravans, but although the water supply is
good, the road is bad about Sinkat.</p>

SUAKIN (SOUTHERLY ROUTE).</h4>

<p>The mileage is estimated by pace of camels, and there appears to
be but little difference between the northerly and southerly
routes; the Arabs, however, call the south road the longer.</p>

<p>Water supply is quite equal to that on north road, and all
wells, being more or less deep sunk, do not get fouled by animals
drinking direct from them, as is the case with surface wells, such
as Dissibil, Hayaba, &amp;c. These wells are also much more used by
Arabs for watering their flocks than those on other track, and,
without exception, they are surrounded by diruks, or earth-made
drinking pans, which are scarce on other road.</p>

<p>A long rope and deluk, or native sort of bucket of thin hide,
would be required at each well.</p>

<p>For movements of troops the north road is infinitely to be
preferred, as going throughout is comparatively easy for all arms.
On south road, numerous agabas, or passes over the hills, make
going hard and difficult. The big agaba between Sinkat and Tamaneb
is almost impossible for wheeled artillery.</p>

<h3><a id="route3"></a>3.—BERBER <span class="sc">to</span>
KASSALA.</h3>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">Compiled in Intelligence Office,
Khartoum, from Various Sketches and Reports, June</span>, 1902.</p>

<p>This route is very difficult to map or describe so as to be of
use to the traveller, as there are hardly half a dozen unmistakable
objects along it by which he could identify his position.</p>

<p>As the Atbara dries up, it leaves a series of pools along its
bed. Where the banks allow of these pools being approached by
animals, the Arabs’ flocks are taken to water, and paths are beaten
or cut through the bush leading to these meshras.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Guides.</span>The ordinary Arab guide,
even if he has been in the habit of travelling by this road for
years, knows only a small number of these meshras, <em>i.e.</em>,
those most conveniently situated for the class of journey he has
been in the habit of performing, and only one or two of the
countless tracks. The only people who know all the small meshras
off the road, and they perhaps over a limited portion of the river,
are the Arabs (Hadendoas) who are grazing their flocks there. If
the traveller, therefore, because he is marching with troops or for
any other reason, wishes to use the less well-known meshras, he
must depend on local inquiries and should, therefore, have with him
men who speak Hadendoa.</p>

<p>Another great difficulty is the comparatively small number of
men who know the names of any except the chief meshras.
Consequently the average guide makes the names he knows extend over
the whole length of the river. Where one ends, another begins. The
Arabs grazing their flocks by the Atbara, on the other hand, will
give you names for each little bit of the river, but these names
are of little value, as no one else knows them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rest houses.</span>There are rest houses
at intervals of about 20 miles between Berber and Kassala.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grazing.</span>There is good grazing for
camels practically the whole way.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Travellers.</span>Persons travelling by
themselves in the hot weather may find it best to march very early
in the morning, halt at water, and march again near sunset,
carrying enough water for the night-halt away from the river.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>No supplies of any sort
are to be got along road, except perhaps milk and sheep.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>There is good fishing in the
Atbara. Gazelle, bustard and ariel are seen along the route in
localities, varying with the season. Wild asses are numerous north
of Goz Regeb.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>Some Bisharin are met,
and a good many nomad Hadendoas.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General Remarks.</span>The most direct
road to Maman is the old telegraph route which leaves Kassala in
N.N.E. direction past the north end of J. Mokram, and after
following the new telegraph line for about 10 miles then turns
nearly due north and leaves the new telegraph to the east. Country:
good going, covered with scattered bush, but thicker along khors,
some of which are more or less serious obstacles in the rains.
Though water is not plentiful along this route it was sufficient in
April, 1900, to enable a party of 50 Camel Corps, 2 horses, 50
natives on foot, and 2,000 head of cattle and sheep to reach the
wells at Tukruf, near Kassala, without any special arrangements for
water.</p>

leaving Adarama the road goes E. for about 6 miles over sandy soil
covered with tufts of dry tabas grass. Jebel Asoteribab is visible
to the S.E. Khor Amab is then crossed; this is always dry, I was
told; it comes from S.E., and runs a little way further to the N.
Osman Digna is said to have had his extreme E. outpost of 20 men
here to levy blackmail on anyone coming to Berber. There are acacia
bushes in this khor. Two miles after crossing the khor, the range
Jebel Tobrar comes into view. All bushes cease here, and for 4 or 5
miles the way is over an undulating sandy country with tufts of
withered grass. On descending a low sandy hill, Khor Shedieb is met
running S.W. and draining a black, light sandy plain running E. and
W., along which the way proceeds for 6 miles; low sand hills to the
S. The plain is treeless, except a few stunted bushes in Khor
Shedieb. After marching E. over this plain the sand hills begin to
close in at a place called El Yukreik, where there is a little
shade from a few small tundub bushes; this is said to be full of
water and green grass in a rainy year, but it is quite dry now;
this is about 20 miles distant from Adarama. The direction is then
eastwards through a succession of valleys shut in by low sand hills
running N. and S. about 3 miles by 3 miles. One valley, just before
entering the Hegerib Plain in which Bir Kerikun lies, is full of
bushes and is cotton soil, but not bad going; there must be a good
deal of water all over this country in a good year, but it is quite
dry now. There is no grass for horses the whole way; the going is
good, but a little heavy over the sand hills from one valley to
another, and also, except just when entering Wadi Hegerib, 3 miles
before reaching Bir Kerikun.</td>

down the khor; after such a storm there is plenty of water,
sufficient, I think, to last for four or five months. There was one
large pool of water, 40 yards long, 8 yards broad, and 10 feet

clean out the sand in a few hours. I think Khor Langeb joins Khor
Araf just near here, running due E. here. Dom palms, tarfa jungle,
and small quantity of green grass on the banks. Five miles up this
khor, on left bank, is Bir Oshi, at mouth of small Khor Oshi; the
same remarks apply to Bir Oshi as to Bir Araf. <em>Bir Gabati</em>,
slightly further on, I was told is the same. There is, I am told,
water in <em>Khor Odi</em>, and a big <em>pool at Areiwat</em>, and
no lack of water further on. On the right bank on entering Khor
Langeb are some graves on a hill, said to be the graves of Roman
soldiers; the Hadendoas are afraid of opening them, though they

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot
(January, 1900) with additions by Captains Boulnois (March, 1900)
and Morant (January</span>, 1901).</p>

<p class="center"><em>General Description.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Road.</span>At this season (January) the
going is good throughout, except for the few miles between Um
Ukheita and Um Rueishid and the first 5 miles out of Rera
eastwards, which portions of the track are very stony. From El
Sadda to Asubri there is at present (1900) no track, so the going
is not so good as in other parts, but there is no obstacle to
camels. The gradients throughout are insignificant. A great portion
of the route is over dark arable soil, which must be impassable
when wet, so that in autumn this route must be difficult for camels
for at any rate a day after heavy rain.</p>

<p>There is plenty of shade up to El Ereigib; after that it is
rarely found and is non-existent for considerable stretches.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rivers.</span>The Atbara bed lies from
100-200 feet below the level of the surrounding plains. On either
side it is bordered by 2 to 4 miles of broken ground covered with
scattered bush, through which the track proceeds by easy gradients.
As a rule it is unfordable at Asubri from end of June to middle of
October. During these months travellers cross by the boat ferry at
Suweihil some 5 miles further south.</p>

<p>The Gash is liable to be unfordable for several days together
during the flood season which lasts during July, August and
September.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>A good deal of dura is
grown near the track and some might be obtainable at the right time
of year. Sheep and milk can be got at many places. Firewood is to
be found everywhere up to El Giseima (66 miles), after that it is
very scarce till the Atbara is reached.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>As tanks are very numerous,
water must be very plentiful in autumn and early winter.</p>

<p>The wells about El Ereigib are very deep; that at Wad Abu Saleh
was found to be roughly 250 feet.</p>

<p>There are still many wells that require digging out and tanks
that want repair. Water was of good quality throughout, and all the
wells visited had an ample supply.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>The village of Um
Dibban and all the country as far as Wad Abu Saleh used to be under
El Taib Abd El Salem, the Sheikh of El Soba. Owing to their having
joined the Mahdi, the Sheikh of El Obeid family have risen in
importance and acquired a certain jurisdiction over the country
east of Um Dibban.</p>

<p>A few Batahin were met with as far as El Giseima, after that
practically all were Shukria or those living with that tribe, as
far as the left bank of the Atbara.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grazing.</span>There is excellent tree
grazing as far as El Giseima, and after that the supply of grass is
so great that one can understand how the enormous flocks and herds
subsisted, that the Shukria claim to have possessed in their palmy
days.</p>

<p>The grass seen was never more than 3 feet high. It is not
burnt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cultivation.</span>An immense area is
capable of growing good crops of dura if the rains are
favourable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>There is practically nothing
to shoot at this season (January) between the Blue Nile and a few
miles of the Atbara.</p>

of Gereif, where there is some cultivation, and at about 12 miles

mounds covered with frequent fragments of stone and brick, said to
be the remains of Old Soba, the road bifurcates and the branch to
the left is taken, a clearly marked track. For the first few miles
the path passes through thinly scattered trees, which gradually get
thicker, till at 23 miles they restrict the view in any direction
to 200 or 300 yards. At 25½ miles a well is passed on the right of
the road, and at 27 miles Um Dibban is reached. This is a scattered
but well-built mud village on perfectly flat ground, from which all
vegetation has been removed for a radius of 1,000 to 1,500

tracts of strong rich soil and wadis are crossed, and there are
many, it would be impracticable in the wet season at times.</p>

<p>From Abu Deleig to Shendi the going is good enough, probably all
the year round, but many deepish khors would form serious obstacles
in the rains.</p>

<p>The Atbara was 2½ feet deep, and 60 yards wide.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>A fair amount of dura is
grown near Sheg and Geleita. It was easily obtainable there in
small quantities.</p>

<p>A great deal is grown in Hawad, a very fertile district, and
also a certain amount in Abu Deleig in good years, but it all
depends on the rainfall. Very little from Abu Deleig to Shendi.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wood.</span>Firewood is not to be
obtained between Goz Regeb and within 10 miles of Abu Deleig;
plenty elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>None from Goz Regeb to Sheg,
about 65 miles.</p>

<p>Tanks very numerous near and in Hawad.</p>

<p>Water only obtainable at Ladda, between Abu Deleig and Shendi;
but there are numerous tanks, though all dry at this time.</p>

<p>Water is of good quality, especially at Abu Deleig.</p>

<h3><a id="route16"></a>16.—EL DAMER <span class="sc">to</span>
FASHER (ATBARA).</h3>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Major Bulkeley Johnson, Scots
Greys, October</span>, 1901.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General Remarks. Road.</span>From El
Damer to Goz Regeb the road is stony and sandy, with open desert or
open bush. Going: good for horses in open formation but slightly
heavy; for artillery, heavy, with a strain on the horses the whole
journey. I should suggest some form of detachable broad sand tyre
to prevent sinking of the wheels, as suggested in Journal of
Artillery Institute, of, I think, September, 1901.</p>

<p>From Goz Regeb to Sofi the road is a single track through long
grass on a high plateau, 2 or 3 miles from river, which is
difficult of access owing to broken ground gradually sloping to
river, which is cut up by innumerable khors, water courses, and
bush.</p>

<p>The going over the single track is good for horses, but bad for
guns, as both horses and wheels must go through the long grass, and
horses’ feet are continually slipping inwards as the track is
narrow and generally deep. At times, as between Sofi and Mogatta,
the path is completely lost and overgrown with kittr—bad enough for
single horses, but still worse for pairs or led horses; the gun
horses on two occasions coming in red with blood from shoulders
down. I would suggest outside blinkers for gun horses in bush to
protect the eyes from thorns.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>During first portion of
road, El Damer to Goz Regeb, the river is difficult of access owing
to thick bush and high banks, except in recognized meshras, often
far apart. Water very good; camps good and shady.</p>

<p>On second portion, Goz Regeb to Fasher, river often 3 miles
away, and very difficult of access. Meshras very few owing to
broken ground, thick bush, and deep khors running in every
direction; camps fair and shady.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Grasses.</span>On Atbara up to Goz Regeb,
halfa grass is plentiful along the banks. After El Fasher plenty of
green abu rokba, abu arid, and neghil, by far the best being abu
arid, which, green or dry, is always taken by the natives in
preference to any other for horses and cattle. Naal is apparently
no use as food, but adaa or false dura is better than nothing.</p>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot,
January</span>, 1903.</p>

<p>There are at least three roads.</p>

<p>The western goes by Abu, or El, Gassas, a district apparently
included in another called Rotamat (I am not sure of this). Last
water at Abu Gassas. It afterwards passes some cultivation, but no
water except in autumn.</p>

<p>The eastern goes by Tundub and Wad Arrak, where last water is,
and joins the middle road about 10 miles from Geili.</p>

<p>The middle one was followed, and is described below.</p>

<p>No real road to begin with, simply tracks from village to
village. For the first 9 miles, as far as the village of Kemeilab,
through cultivation all the way. Several villages on either side of
road. Then through thin laot bush, but plenty of cultivation round
about.</p>

<p>The direct and more generally used road to Mogatta starts from
Gedaref in a nearly northerly direction, and leaves J. Buadra about
1¼ miles to the right, and the scene of the battle of Gedaref ¼ of
a mile on the left hand. After passing through much cultivation and
high grass, the filthy village of Wad Gabu on the top of a small
hill is reached. The water supply of this village is from a well
some 2½ or 3 miles to the W. or S.W., and animals have to be sent
there, as very little water is obtainable at the village itself.
There is a rest house here.</p>

<p>J. Kassamon is visible nearly due N. About 2¼ miles further on
the telegraph line and an alternative route from Gedaref,
<em>viâ</em> Seraf El Buadra and Bir Rowajda, which is generally
dry, joins in.</p>

<p>From here to R. Atbara, at Mogatta, there is no water, and the
country is most uninteresting. In the rains the scrub and scattered
bush is almost concealed by high grass; this is burnt in the dry
season, and the country then is bare black cotton soil, and devoid
of any grazing for animals. About 12 miles from the river dense
bush, chiefly kittr, begins, and continues until the halting place
at Mogatta is reached. This road is nearly 20 miles shorter than
that <em>viâ</em> Sofi.</p>

N.W. slopes of the Abyssinian mountains, brings down a large volume
of water when in flood. It enters the Nile at an angle of 70°, and
its bed in February was 3 feet higher than the water surface of the
Blue Nile at that time. The Rahad, with the exception of a few
pools, is dry for many months of the year. Its banks at the
junction are steep and high, quite 39 feet over the bed, which has
a width of 71 yards. The flood-marks show that the rise of the
Rahad is from 15 to 19 feet in height. The Blue Nile at this
junction forms an “S” curve, taking a sharp bend to the W., and
again another to the E. Its width, is measured, 595 yards. The
banks of the Rahad River are covered with thick and dense jungle,
as are both banks of the Blue Nile in this reach. Shortly before
Wad Medani is reached, the W. bank becomes open again, but the
forest on the E. bank is continuous.</td>

the Mukashfi cultivation, the road leads across an uninhabited
waterless plain until Segadi is reached. This plain, on which
numerous camels are grazed during the rains, is, as a rule, open
and covered with naal and siha grass intersected at intervals by
belts of kittr, the thickest and widest is in the last 4 miles
before reaching the hamlet on the north of J. Segadi. Another
outlying hamlet is Ereiga, which was passed but not seen, about 4
miles from the jebel which strongly resembles J. Kassala on a small
scale. It consists of two main granite masses lying north-east and
south-west, the wells being between them. There is also one on the
western side of main jebel. The village, which must contain some
1,500 inhabitants, is close to the western face of the larger
jebel. The population is very mixed, and many only live here during
the dry season. Torin Ahmed (Rufaa) is Sheikh of this heterogeneous
crowd. There are said to be caves in the jebels here, which
doubtless occasionally harbour bad characters from the Gezira and
elsewhere.</td>

weather the inhabitants (probably 2,000) disperse or else carry
their water from Segadi. The Omda’s name is El Imam Hadibai, and
the majority of the population are Amarna, a few Hameg and Gowama.

<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.—This was the route followed by the
expedition against Ibrahim Wad Mahmud in February and March, 1904.
It has not, hitherto, been the usual route to Keili, but as it is
the most direct, and could be easily improved, it will probably be
adopted, at any rate for Government purposes.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the Khor Ofat to Keili (50 miles) there are no
inhabitants and in February, 1904, no track. There is little
difficulty about water, which stands in pools in the Khor Ofat, or
can be easily obtained by digging in its bed. The distances cannot
be taken as accurate.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Road.</span>Is in good condition
throughout. It is very level, except where it crosses a khor or
skirts a hill closely, there are no long ascents or descents. The
large khors are all very shallow and broad, with sandy beds, so
that at the present time of year, when they are all empty, they do
not cause the slightest delay. When passing near a hill the road is
generally rough and uneven, and covered with loose stones, and in
addition numerous small khors have to be crossed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Country.</span>Is as a rule dead
flat, with the exception of the Jebels, which are like so many
islands. Except where there is cultivation, there is nothing but
bush, varying in thickness, and grass, which is now being burnt.
Cultivation as a rule consists of dura and semsem, but except where
mentioned there is nothing but bush. Where the grass has been
burnt, progress on foot through the bush is fairly easy as a
rule.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>Is very scarce. All the
khors are now (December) dry, but water can be obtained from holes
scraped in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> bed.
The supply is rapidly decreasing, and in two or three places where
water was obtainable on our way out to Gezan, no water could be
obtained on our way back, only three days later.</p>

<p>Between the Khor Sumba and the Khor Karri, however, water
appears to be plentiful, and in the Khor Tumat itself there seems
to be an ample supply just below the surface.</p>

channel narrow at first; opens out from 30 yards to 80 yards a
couple of miles up. Water is clear, and of a dark brown tinge.
Jebel el Zeraf lies away to the south-east on R. bank 5 miles off;
there are four distinct hills, all of volcanic rock, covered with
bush. A broad open plain, marsh near the river, extends to the foot
of these hills R., while L. is wooded and scrub—open plain behind;
here hippopotami, elephant, giraffe, water-buck, and reed-buck have
been seen.</td>

regular channel gets lost as it flows to the west of clump of Dom
behind Kuek, where it gets blocked by sudd, the water finding its
way through the marsh and lagoons. The “Abu Klea” continued
(October, 1898) in a southerly direction, and after crossing a
lagoon 11 feet deep, which shallowed down to 4 feet, the main
channel again struck, 18 feet deep.</td>

villages, and natives say it is blocked by sudd lower down. This
channel through which neither steamer or gyassa could get is
evidently that mentioned by Peake, between 150 and 160 miles, which
he went through, and which was only 5 feet deep. It is now just

<td class="tdl-top hang1">Channel goes on another 13 miles, then
ends in 3 feet of water on large sudd-covered lake. A large maya
goes off N.E., which is declared closed about 5 miles up; this
water probably forms the River “Lotus” farther down. If it is
intended to go from the Bahr el Zeraf to the Bahr el Jebel, natives
should be got from Ajiung to direct the course, which lies entirely
through patches of sudd and open water. The direction marked on the
map should be somewhat more towards the north. The channel at
Ajiung, which is broad and deep, soon narrows, and current becomes
less as the head is reached, clearly showing that a great deal of
the water in the channel at Ajiung flows through the reeds and
sudd, where the depth appears to be about 4 feet. The whole country
S. and S.W. of Ajiung appears to be one vast sudd-covered lagoon
through which the waters forming the Bahr el Zeraf flow until the
main channel is formed; pieces of sudd measuring 40 yards by 30
were met after a severe storm in the western branch. Such pieces of
sudd are liable at any time to block the present channel and cause
a fresh one to open out.</td>

"route55"></a>55.—WAU TO TEMBURA.</h3>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Captain A. B. Bethel, R.A.,
August</span>, 1904.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water, etc.</span>In the dry season, I
consider that this road would present a good many difficulties in
the way of water supply for troops or animal transport using
it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport.</span>In the wet season, the
road is only fit for carrier transport, as many of the khors are so
full that it would entail swimming the animals across, and carrying
the baggage over by hand; bridging one or two more of the khors
would assist matters a good deal, but the River Bo is too wide for
a bridge to be thrown across it, and I think it quite possible that
these small native-made bridges would be swept away in the deep
khors. A small Berthon boat is indispensable to anyone using this
road in the wet season.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Track and country.</span>The track is a
well marked one the whole way. After leaving the Zeriba of Kutsuk
Ali, the country becomes undulating till Khor Abera is reached, and
there are several ridges, with steep ascents and descents; from
this, the track is fairly flat till it reaches Tembura’s village,
though, S. of Gedi’s village, it runs along the foot of the Undili
Mountains. In the wet season, the track is very much overgrown with
grass and short scrub to the S. of Ali’s Babai; N. of it, the grass
is not so high, nor so thick, but the going is bad, as much of the
track is under water, and it is especially so between Khors
Gullamba and Gumbola.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>Roads everywhere fair,
except between River Adda and Hofrat El Nahas, where no track at
all, and in parts between Ragaa and Deim Zubeir which require
clearing of undergrowth and bush. This is now being done.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>Game is plentiful near rivers
and khors still holding water. No elephants seen, but they must be
very numerous in rains, from many tracks which cut up roads in
parts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trade goods.</span>Cloth and clothing
asked for everywhere. Hard cash taken at Kossinga and Ragaa.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>In dry season ample water to
be found at no greater distance apart than 21 miles.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rivers and khors.</span>In rains the many
rivers and khors would take a lot of time and trouble to cross, and
a Berthon boat would be indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Camps, &amp;c.</span>Fair camping grounds
found almost everywhere and wood always.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fly.</span>Fly is bad everywhere, and
would be probably fatal to horses or camels. Strong healthy mules
and donkeys seem to stand it, but weak, sickly and those with bad
sores succumb.</p>

of scarcity of water.</p>

<p>Most of country between Omdurman and El Safia is so barren that
the grazing grounds are very limited in area, and the population is
so sparse that beaten tracks are only to be found in the vicinity
of the watering places.</p>

<p>Most of the country is scattered with low samr bush, which, not
being in leaf owing to the scarcity of rain this year, affords
little shade. Dead trees afford an abundant supply of fuel. Many
wells get partly filled up with drift sand, or with mud brought
down by the infiltration of water, which may be quickly cleaned
out. The supply at all wells is dependent on the amount of
rainfall.</p>

<p>N.B.—As there are no well-defined tracks, and the distances have
been measured off the map, they are probably all too short.—H. H.

<p>The route from Debba to El Obeid is little used, even during the
kharif when water is comparatively plentiful. At that season a few
merchants carry dates to El Obeid, perhaps carrying back gum in
exchange. The portion of the route from Debba to Safia is subject
to variations according to the whim of the guide employed, as well
as the season of the year. Some prefer the route Um Belila—El
Amri—Hobagi—Haraza without going to Safia, whilst others during the
dry season travel <em>viâ</em> Wabri, Inderab, Gumr, Gambar,
Habisa, Bagbag, and Kagmar.</p>

<p>The track described below was plainly marked throughout, but,
owing to scarcity of water, would be difficult, at any rate during
the driest season, for a party of over twenty-five camels. Shade
and firewood are plentiful throughout.</p>

<p>In the following report the only places where there was any
water on the road are mentioned.</p>

opened with a little labour, and water got at from 50 feet to 90

defensive post, are the wells. There are at present (1901) nine
wells giving water, and the Arabs of the Hamar and Kaja tribes are
opening more. I have taken accurate measurements of depths of
wells, and the depth varies from 50 to 80 feet below the surface.
Water is only found in very small quantities at present, no well
being able to water more than 30 camels per diem.</p>

<p>In the rains the Arabs dig, and have dug for many years, shallow
hollows which fill up and last them through the winter sufficient
to water their flocks; but this year, owing to very scanty
rainfall, these hollows are all dry.<a id=

<p>There are many villages in the neighbourhood, consisting of ten

many ostriches, which at this time of year are all plucked quite
bare. The feathers are taken to Nahud, where there is a good market
for them.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">General Description of BAHR EL ARAB and DAR EL
HOMR</span>.</h3>

<p>Immediately one emerges from the hilly country of the Nubas a
vast level plain meets the eye, absolutely devoid of landmarks: the
soil changes abruptly to rich black cotton soil with fissures, some
so broad and deep that it is dangerous for bulls and donkeys, owing
to their getting their legs jammed in the cracks. The
surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> of the land
is uniformly covered with talh and heglig trees; occasionally
tamarind and kau trees are met. Only two india-rubber trees were
seen. The natives do not appear to know the use of these. The Bahr
El Arab in section is very shallow, with no defined banks, and at
this time of year water is more or less in pools. All the
confluents are the same shallow watercourses, and the country
appears to be one vast swamp in the rains. Only in a few places,
Fauwel, Keilak, and Kuek, do the Homr Arabs remain throughout the
year, as they say that the flies and mosquitoes torment men and
beasts to such an extent as to make life unbearable.</p>

<p>N.B.—During the dry season, merchants do not travel <em>viâ</em>
Hobagi, as the hofra there is then dry. A considerable détour is
made from El Amra to Elai, thence to Habisa, where there many
wells, and thence to Bagbag Wells and Kajmar.</p>

Fura. They consist of a number of holes, 3 or 4 feet in diameter,
and a few feet in depth, and are sunk in the usual manner in the
channel of a large river bed—Fura. They are rudely excavated and
are unlined, their falling in, therefore, is a matter of frequent
occurrence, and these accidents are repaired by the excavation of
new holes. A basin with puddled sides is formed on the surface for
the use of animals. During the rainy season the holes are rapidly
filled with deposit, and they have then to be re-made. On the other
hand, in the dry season, the wells are gradually deepened, as the
water level falls through use, absorption, and evaporation. Cattle,
sheep, and goats are driven here in large numbers. It is the custom
during the hot season to water the sheep and goats once every four
days, and the cattle every other day. In the winter season they are
driven to the wells every sixth and fourth day respectively. The
water at these wells is good, and the supply generally plentiful.

<p><span class="sidenote">General Remarks.</span>Except for patches
of sand, heavy for infantry and horses, the road is good
throughout, with the exception of the Magaga defile. Though the
road frequently changes from one bank to the other of the Khor Abu
Dom, up whose valley it generally proceeds till it crosses the
watershed into the Magaga basin, none of the crossings present any
difficulty; but there is always the danger in the summer months of
a spate caused by rain near the head.</p>

<p>Firewood and camel grazing are plentiful throughout, but there
is practically no grass for horses.</p>

<p>As far as, and including, Kalas the road may be considered as
having been traversed at the driest time of year.</p>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot,
R.E., November</span>, 1903.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General remarks.</span>The only obstacles
to taking a bee line for Gabra are the Abu Meru or Merkhait hills,
which have to be skirted either on the N. or on the S., and the Goz
Abu Delua which has to be crossed. The latter is a belt of
undulating ground, covered lightly with sand in some places, and
perhaps heavily in others, running generally in N.N.E. by S.S.W.
direction and probably varying in width. The best place to cross it
is at the Hanakat El Goz, where a khor cuts its way through it.
This may be looked on as an obligatory point, and it is here and
round the northern and southern sides of the Merkhiat hills only
that one sees signs of a definite path until within a few miles of
the wells. After rain, water is said to stand in a place called
Shegeig or Mushgeig near the Goz, otherwise there is no water on
the road. After passing the Merkhait hills firewood abounds and
grass was plentiful at the time of this journey. Trees are chiefly
“samr” with a few “kittr,” “heglig,” and other bushes. There is no
“hashab” as stated on Khartoum Sheet. A great deal of spear grass
is met with, and the guide informed me that, but for his skilful
leading, I should have met much more.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of any track and the tussocky nature of the
“tabas” grass, the going is not good, except in the neighbourhood
of the Id Ennala.</p>

<p>The distances given in this route report are obtained by
assuming the camels to have marched at about 2½ miles an hour,
checked by measuring wheel; but the route taken was far from
straight.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span><a id=
"route119"></a>119.—GABRA <span class="sc">to</span> KORTI.</h3>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot,
December</span>, 1903.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General remarks.</span>Till within a few
miles of Korti the Wadi Mogaddam was practically followed
throughout. It seems not to be used at all as a caravan road, as
there is no track and no caravans were met. At the same time it
seems an easy road to Omdurman, and very straight as far as
Gabra.</p>

<p>The country passed through is flat and uninteresting. No hills
of any remarkable height were seen, the highest being to the W. and
N.W. of Gabra.</p>

<p>None of those near the route exceed 200 feet to 250 feet,
relative height.</p>

<p>The Wadi Mogaddam consists of a depression marked by a belt of
trees or grass, without any water channel whatever. Evidently there
is never any flow of water on the surface of the wadi.</p>

<p>The belt of trees varies in width and character. At Gabra it
must be nearly ¾ mile wide, and thick though not dense. There are
some good “sayal,” “heglig,” “tundub,” and “samr” trees; lower down
the trees diminish in size, the “sayal” is rarely met, and with the
exception of a little “arak” and “kurmet” there is hardly anything
but “samr” to be seen, with “tundub” in places. From Gaerin “selem”
begins to be seen, and soon it becomes the principal growth.</p>

<p>Below Um Harot no grass was seen except burnt-up “tabas,” but
that must depend on the year. On the whole, grazing for camels was
very fair, but practically none for horses.</p>

<p>The line taken presented no difficulties whatever in the way of
rocks or gradients. From a camel point of view there is no heavy
sand, but it is not recommended as a route for motor-cars.</p>

<p>No supplies to be obtained except sheep and milk. Firewood is
plentiful everywhere. Water seemed good everywhere except at Um
Harot, where it was a little salt. The wells are all about 120 to
140 feet deep, except at Gabra, where they were 60 feet to 70
feet.</p>

<p>A guide is indispensable. With a guide there is no difficulty in
marching by moonlight.</p>

<p>From the source to a little below the wells appears to be called
Khor Bayuda. Up to this point it has a defined bed, in which water
flows after rain. After passing J. Barkol it becomes Wadi Barkol,
being now, and remaining, a broad wadi with no water channel. Soon
after it becomes Wadi El Zein, till it is joined by the large Wadi
Abu Gia, whose name it retains till near Korti. It is not quite
clear whether it keeps it to the end or adopts the name Abu Gidean
after its junction with that wadi.</p>

<p>The going is extremely good, there being no difficulty
whatever.</p>

<p>Though a good deal used, there is no marked track till near the
wells. The numerous small isolated hills act as efficient
landmarks, so that everyone takes his own line.</p>

<p>Except for the short and uncertain period when green grass can
be obtained, “selem” is the best camel grazing in all this country.
It is found almost all the way in the wadi.</p>

<p>No supplies were obtainable of any sort on the road or at Bayuda
wells in December, 1903.</p>

<p>A little shade is to be got in winter, but practically none in
summer.</p>

<p>The distances were measured by wheel and adjusted to the
astronomical positions. The hours are those actually marched by
light hamla.</p>

<h3><a id="route121"></a>121.—BAYUDA WELLS <span class=

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Colonel Hon. M. G. Talbot,
December</span>, 1903.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General Remarks.</span>From Bayuda wells
to Wadi Abu Gia there is an extremely well marked track, profusely
beaconed in the Arab manner. Further N. the stream of traffic
divides according to the part of the Merowe district for which the
traveller is bound or from which he starts.</p>

<p>The going is excellent throughout; no difficulties whatever.</p>

<p>The route appears to be of recent origin.</p>

<p>Formerly the produce of the Province used to make its way to
Berber <em>via</em> Sani, and this new trade route, sometimes
called the Hawashawi route, from a hill of that name, seems to have
been established to meet the new conditions in the Sudan.</p>

<p>From Bayuda the route keeps straight on, crossing the Goz Abu
Delua just before reaching Hanboti, and strikes the Nile near the
Shabluka. Between Bayuda and Merowe there are considerable
stretches without any camel grazing, and there is no shade of any
value in hot weather. The distances were measured by wheel and
adjusted to the astronomical positions.</p>

<h3><a id="route122"></a>122.—THE ARBAÏN ROAD.</h3>

<p class="sch3">(<em>Compiled by the Editor.</em>)</p>

<p>The “forty days” road leads S.S.W. across the desert from
Assiut, in Upper Egypt, <em>viâ</em> the oases of Kharga, Beris,
Sheb, Selima, Lagia, and Bir El Sultan to El Fasher capital of
Darfur. It was formerly in considerable use for bringing slave
caravans, &amp;c., from the Sudan, and is still used in parts to a
limited extent by natron caravans, occasional smugglers, and
others. It is, however, now practically deserted.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1884 a reconnaissance was made by Lt.-Col.
Colvile and Lieut. Stuart-Wortley from Assiut to Lagia, in order to
find out whether the forces of the Mahdi could penetrate into Egypt
by this road. The result of the patrol was satisfactory, and
demonstrated that, owing to the paucity of water on the road, it
would be quite impossible for a force of any size to traverse
it.</p>

<p>The total length of the Darb El Arbaïn, from Assiut to El
Fasher, is certainly not less than one thousand (1,000) miles. To
cover this stretch in forty days would appear to necessitate
particularly excellent camels, but the following is the normal time
taken, according to native report:—</p>

<p>A day’s journey in summer lasts from El Asr (two hours before
sunset) till one hour after sunrise; and in winter from sunrise
till three hours after sunset.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Description</span>.</h4>

<p>The only points south of Kharga which have been astronomically
fixed in modern times are Kassaba and Sheb (Talbot, 1903), and
therefore the distances between the main points given below must be
considered more or less approximate. The road is hardly defined at
all throughout its length, and variations occur at different
points. A road also joins the Arbaïn from Mut (Dakhla Oasis) at
Terfawi (five days).</p>

<p>On no account should an intending traveller move without
reliable guides, who may usually be obtained, or heard of, at
Assiut.</p>

Surrounding this knoll is a narrow valley, about 80 yards broad, to

digging at a depth of from 3½ to 5 feet. The water does not run in
very rapidly, but the earth is so light that the well can be dug
very rapidly, filling to about 9 inches in six hours; water good

<p>Bir Sultan, otherwise known as Wadi Natrun (the Natron Valley),
Bir el Melha, or Bir Zaghawa, lies in the centre of a plain,
bounded by hills to the N.W., N., and E. Three or four pans of good
water; ground below the sand being white clay. A little N.W. lie
the natron diggings, the natron being in a seam 2 inches deep, a
few inches below the sandy surface. One and a half miles E. of the
natron is J. Kashaf. Plenty of scrub and grazing. At Melani, under
the eastern slope, the soil is quite damp.</p>

<p>Bir Sultan lies 10 days due W. of Old Dongola.</p>

<p>Zaghawa, which is marked on some maps as a definite place, is
the name of the district inhabited by the nomad Arab tribe of that
name. It is full of khors and wells, and is stated to be 4 days to
S.W. of Bir Sultan. There is a little-used track from Lagia which
passes through Zaghawa district and proceeds towards El Fasher, but
it is not the Arbaïn Road. The Zaghawa people often come to the Bir
Sultan.</p>

<p>From Bir Sultan to El Fasher the accounts of the road are
contradictory. One account states that it is 10 days hard
travelling, without water on the road, and that camels have to be
specially trained for the journey. Other accounts say that from Bir
Sultan to J. Meidob,<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> or to Bir Maharia (water at either
place), the journey takes 4 to 5 days; on to Toma, in the midst of
a cultivated populous district, 3 days; and on to El Fasher 1 day
more. Another road appears to lead <em>viâ</em> Anka, 7 days from
Fasher, and is said to take 15 days altogether; this is the one
said to be generally used.</p>

<p>(Browne, in 1793, went from Bir El Melha (Sultan), <em>viâ</em>
Medwa (?), S.W. to Wadi Mazruk and then S.E. to Kobe, but left a
very meagre description of the actual journey.)</p>

<h3><a id="route124"></a>124.—KASSALA <span class="sc">to</span>
MASSAUA.</h3>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Lieutenant H. H. S. Morant
(1898); Completed with Material taken from Reports by Colonel Hon.
M. G. Talbot (1900) and Mr. F. B. Hohler</span> (1901).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General Description. The road.</span>The
general direction of Massaua from Kassala is almost due E. From
Sabderat to Keren the Italians have cleared a roadway about 50 feet
in width, from which most of the stones and all vegetation, except
an occasional large baobab tree, have been cleared. It is so
clearly marked that a stranger could march by it even on a dark
night. The only point of any difficulty is the low saddle at Bisha,
where there was still room for a good deal of work (1900). In its
long straight lines it reminds one strongly of the old Roman roads;
it crosses ravines and water-courses at whatever angle it happens
to strike them, but at many of the steeper ascents and descents
narrow ramps have been cut. In several places along it the Italians
have made new masonry wells.</p>

<p>The accompanying road report was made before the construction of
this newly cleared road—which from Sabderat to Daura Obel passes N.
of the old route, <em>viâ</em> Algeden and Eladal—and there is no
detailed information at hand as to the water supply along that
portion of the route, though there is said to be no difficulty in
this respect for the ordinary traveller.</p>

<p>From Keren to Asmara, and thence after many zig-zags to Saati,
there is an excellent driving road about 14 feet wide, with the
exception of a length of about 6 miles before reaching Azteklezan,
which had not (April, 1900) been completed to the full width, but
was then practicable for wheeled vehicles. Throughout the length of
this metalled road the gradients are occasionally of necessity
rather steep; the kilometers are marked throughout.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Country.</span>From Kassala to Keren the
general character of the country strongly resembles much of that
between Kassala and Suakin, and consists as a rule of level
waterless plains of firm soil, at times sandy or gravelly, covered
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> fine short
grass and scattered bushes of the acacia tribe, and intersected
here and there by shallow sandy khors, which during the rainy
season carry off the drainage from the rocky volcanic hills and
granite koppies, which are so characteristic of this particular
part of Africa.</p>

<p>From Keren to Massaua the character of the country entirely
changes and the waterless plains and thorny acacias of the
Kassala-Keren route are replaced by running streams and precipitous
mountains, overgrown with euphorbia and wild olives, both on the
ascent to the Asmara plateau, as well as in the descent to the
maritime plain of Massaua.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Transport animals.</span>For the entire
journey mules are most suitable, but as far as Keren camels answer
admirably. From Keren to Massaua, <em>viâ</em> Asmara, wheeled
vehicles, mules or horses. If the direct desert route from Keren to
Massaua be taken, camels are desirable, if not indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>Milk, goats, cattle,
&amp;c., are found, as elsewhere in the Sudan, throughout the
route.</p>

<p>There are occasional small canteens at intervals, and fair
stores at Keren, and some good shops at Asmara and Massaua, where
most ordinary requirements are obtainable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Water.</span>If desired to move a force
larger than a company along this route, enquiries as to state of
water supply should be made, as it varies considerably according to
the time of year.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Inhabitants.</span>Speaking generally,
the inhabitants between Kassala-Keren are Beni-Amer; after that a
bastard type of Abyssinian, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate along this
route is on the whole good. Between Kassala-Keren and Ginda-Massaua
it is decidedly hot in March, April, and May—probably in other
months also. These are also the more feverish portions of the
route, though probably no part of it is so unhealthy as Kassala.
Between the sea and Agordat there occur in April what the Italians
call the “little rains,” which mean very heavy thunder-storms;
these cease before the end of the month, and the rainy season
proper begins towards the end of May.</p>

<p>The climate on the Asmara plateau is said to be delightful,
though perhaps the rains are excessive.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>There is little or no game
along this route, except between Kassala and Keren, where ariel,
gazelle, dig-dig, and guinea fowl may be met with.</p>

Plenty of shade, but very little water (April, 1898). The path
continues good over a level plain with scattered bush until Eladal
is reached. Here there is a telegraph office, but only one well
with extremely little water (April, 1898). Continuing, the track,
after crossing a low saddle, traverses a defile with high rocky
jebels on either side for about 5 miles, and then, after crossing a
wooded basin, ascends a high saddleback, from the summit of which a
fine view is obtainable. From here the track descends by a rather
steep and rocky pass to the wells of Daura Obel, which lie in the
bed of a khor which finds an exit to the S., being shut in on three
sides by high ground. After 2 miles this high ground is left
behind, and a similar distance further on another khor is crossed,
apparently flowing N. It must be somewhere near this point that the

rather a meagre water supply. From here the path continues up the
scattered bush-covered valley of a tributary of the Baraka, until
Agat is reached; here there are several wells, and water seems
plentiful. After leaving Agat, the valley narrows considerably,
though the plain which bears slight indications of cultivation (the
first seen since leaving Kassala) continues level until reaching
the foot of the somewhat steep ascent to the plateau (4,470 feet
approx.) on which the fortress and town of Keren are situated. This
of course belonged to Egypt in the old days, and was then known as
Senhit, from the name of a small village still existing. The fort,

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Captain H. H. S. Morant,
March</span>, 1900.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">General remarks.</span>From Ambarab to
Sogada the road is good enough for camels, and is kept open by
frequent small caravans. There was also said to be a route from
Todluk to Sogada, which was however described as “bad,” probably
hilly.</p>

<p>Beyond Sogada the road itself presents no great difficulties,
but the absence of traffic<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> has allowed the thorny
bushes to close in on it to such an extent as to very seriously
interfere with loaded or riding camels almost the whole way to
Gira.</p>

<p>Once the Setit is reached, there is no real difficulty about
water, but after the first 15 miles or so below Maietib the water
is only accessible at certain places. The further you descend the
river, the broader the strip of broken ground becomes on each side
of the stream, the further the road keeps from it, and the wider
apart are the watering places.</p>

<p>Probably the best plan when marching along the valley is to
spend the heat of the day on the river, and the night on the
plateau above.</p>

<p>Water should be carried in fantasses, as skins get cut to pieces
by the thorns.</p>

<p>Cutting tools are desirable.</p>

<p>No supplies are obtainable nearer than Gedaref on the Setit.
There are no settled inhabitants east of the village of Wad
Heleiwa, 11½ miles E. of Sofi on the Atbara.</p>

buildings). From the Suk there is very steep path leading up to the
village of Wahni (uninhabited when seen); this is situated on the
top of Kamachela, a plateau sloping away to the N. There is a
little cultivation below (dura and cotton), but grain can only be
bought in very limited quantities. From Wahni Suk track resumes its
old course; after 1 mile a khor (10 yards wide) full of water is
crossed, and ½ mile on track passes through two or three low hills.
½ mile on a small khor of water is crossed. Here the “Candelabra
cactus” makes its first appearance. Path now descends rapidly, and
reaches khor in bottom of valley about 250 feet below Wahni Suk.
Since crossing the Gandoa, khors have all been running more or less
W., but from here, after ascending out of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> valley, another water system is
encountered, the water running N. Path ascends and crosses spurs,
running N. from a square precipitous hill, Tarara Angedibba.</td>

still gradually ascending, reach Goanderat village. Track crosses
two small khors and gradually runs up side of a small valley on to
watershed; now descends slowly, and reaches camping ground at
Barbaria Kora (small amount of water). Ground slopes away for
another 1½ miles, when track descends rapidly down north side of a
gully and, striking down a spur, reaches a saddle; now skirts north
side of spur, path descending rapidly. At mile 12½ track passes
along edge of a sheer precipice; shortly after path runs sharply
down a spur in a more northerly direction; at mile 14 it leaves
spur and leads down steep rocky descent across small khor and
reaches camping place, “Diloa W.”; said to be water in khor, but I
did not see it. Track now very much shut in, thick bush and rough
stony descents, an especially bad one at mile 16¾. At mile 17 track
follows bed of small khor, crossing it continually, track bad,
thick bush, shut in both sides by hills; at mile 19 this khor joins
Ganbilo W.; juncture is called Girad Mwat, there is abundant water.
Follows Ganbilo W., a khor 20 yards wide with pools, crossing it
six times in the next 2¾ miles; track now passes between two hills,
that on N. being very steep and probably end of a ridge which runs
down from Tankal. Path now descends slowly, bamboo jungle, and 1½
miles on reaches junction of two khors, Goandera W., water
plentiful. 1¾ miles on path crosses khor (Tukur Waha W.); path now
along right bank of Jira W., 25 yards wide with large pools, then
cross Ambo W. This comes from a spring about ½ mile further back in
hill, where it bubbles up quite warm; a couple of hundred yards off
on the other side of the Jira lie the hot baths Mwat Abba Mariam.
2½ miles on pass to N. of low hill; hills on N. of path about 400
yards off, Jira W. still lying parallel with road but some way off
to S.; at mile 31¾ track runs close to the Jira, here deep water
but narrow for 500 yards, when a deep khor coming from N. is
crossed; track now leaves Jira and leads up a defile down which a
khor, a tributary of Jira runs; cross this khor for first time at
mile 33, steep precipitous hills on both sides, path ascending
dense bamboo thickets, reach water at mile 37¼. Ascent from Jira
has been 300 or 400 feet; path now descends rapidly 350 feet, and
leads down north side of a flat valley, path good, and reaches
Wanenta, water sufficient for party of 30 or so; now along north
side of valley close under low hills; on south side of valley is a
very prominent cone-shaped hill. Cross Shimel Waha W., water
abundant, and 1 mile on cross small khor, halting-place under a
gemmeiza tree, called Bamba, track level and good; cross Jineta
Mariam W., running water, and 1¼ miles on another running stream,
called Mariam Waha W.; ¼ mile further track passes close north of a
hill; ground now broken up by spurs running northwards; path now
descends and crosses Nefoing Gandoa W. just at the junction with
the Gandoa; another 1½ miles on and Jigebit camping ground on the
Gandoa is reached. 2¼ miles on cross khor of running water, and at
mile 57 cross Barkurkur W., a small khor of flowing water; 2 miles
on track passes south of Tarara Bisaurkudat, and ½ mile on reaches
Malkam Waha W., a small khor of flowing water. At mile 60¾ crosses
a khor of running water and another one 500 or 600 yards on; at
mile 62½ pass close to a bend of the Gandoa, and 1 mile on across
the Wahsha W.; after another mile cross a big khor, and 700 yards
on a small khor with water; another deep khor without water is
crossed, and then the Gandoa is reached. Path skirts it for some
hundreds of yards till it reaches point where Wahni road

undergrowth. After three-quarters of an hour’s march, the Cherika

in May is some 15 yards wide, from 1 to 2 feet deep, with a swift
current; flat, wooded banks. Large, flat, slippery stones make the
crossing rather troublesome. The valley of this river is about ¾
mile wide. The road now rises 290 feet, crossing a spur which juts
out from the hills bounding Kacham’s valley on the W. and dropping
again to 10 feet below the Kacham’s level, crosses the Birr river
50 minutes later. The bed of the Birr at the crossing is some 80
yards wide, the left bank 15 to 20 feet high and the right bank
lower; the water (7th May) runs with a swift current, about 1 foot
deep, over a rocky bed in two channels, separated by a mass of
black rock. 200 yards below the crossing there is a fall of some 30
feet, below which the river runs in a narrow gorge enclosed by
black rocks; 300 yards below this it is crossed by a rough log
bridge. The road from here runs over an undulating grass-covered
plain, bare at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>

May, with a strong current. The crossing is troublesome on account
of very slippery, flat stones. After leaving Monkussa, the track

<p>This road from the lake is the one followed by the Emperor John
when he went down to Matemma with some 20,000 (?) men in 1889 and
was killed by the Dervishes. The rains had barely commenced during
the present journey, therefore there was hardly any grass, and
water was scarce during the first 3 days’ march from the lake. Both
water and grass must be abundant after the rains, and while these
are falling the mountain torrents are said to make the road
impassable; it could be greatly improved by clearing the bamboos
and other trees which in places almost conceal the track.</p>

<p>A mixed Hamla—mules, donkeys and camels—was taken from Kirin to
Kodok, April, 1903.</p>

<p>No rain had fallen, but more water was found in the neighbouring
country than in previous years, so that conditions of water may be
assumed normal for middle of dry season, but more favourable than
usual for extreme end of dry season.</p>

<p>There was no recognised track, and no guides could be obtained
from Kirin, nor would it have been possible to obtain Dinka guides
to make the journey in the reverse direction.</p>

<p>The route followed is not necessarily the best, as probably
deflections were made by guides owing to inter-village fighting or
for other reasons.</p>

end of Chapter II</a> in Vol. I.)</h4>

<p class="sch3"><span class="sc">By Captain Dugmore</span>,
1901.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Country.</span>Near Gondokoro the country
is perfectly flat and 30 feet above the river, covered with
borassus palm near the station, sidr, sunt, and a few tamarinds and
sycamore. Due E. lie the hills of Belinian (about 11 hours’ march).
The surface soil is sandy and the sub-soil clay. There are many
very fertile islands in the Nile covered with cane-like reed, very
like papyrus. Natives prefer to live on and cultivate these
islands, as they are not subject to white ants, grasshoppers,
caterpillars, and blight, with all of which cultivation has to
contend on the mainland. Flocks of small birds do great damage to
grain crops. At high Nile these islands are subject to inundation;
the natives then go over to the mainland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>The station now
occupied at Gondokoro occupies the site of the old Egyptian post—a
good many of the old trenches and parapets still exist. The old
buildings, &amp;c., have long ago fallen into the river, which is
said to be twice (?) as wide now as it was in Baker’s time. Baker’s
old camp (“Ismailia”) is in a swampy, low-lying piece of ground,
about 2 miles N. of the old Egyptian station. Two date palms, 11
lemon trees, and two custard apple trees, still remain at
Gondokoro.</p>

<p>Rain percolating and the river washing away cause continual
falls of the bank.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Garrison.</span>One company of Uganda
Rifles (Sudanese), under a British Captain, Lieutenant, and
Sergeant-Instructor. A small number of Police or Constabulary have
been added, and are under the control of the Civil Authority, viz.:
a Collector.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Supplies.</span>At present nearly all
stores, ammunition, and clothing, come from Mombasa, India, and
England, <em>viâ</em> Kampala. Food is obtained by purchase from
the natives.<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class=
"fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Natives grow red dura and maize chiefly, also a small amount of
semsem, telabun, ful (ground nut), and lubia (small pea or bean).
The ground nut does particularly well in the sandy soil. The sweet
potato requires irrigation, and the natives do not take kindly to
such laborious work.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>The climate is fairly
good, the rainy season at its commencement being the worst time of
the year. Temperature:—</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Seasons.</span>Hot weather commences
middle of November and lasts till end of March. Rains commence (or
should do so) last week in March and last till middle of June, they
commence again middle of July and last till middle of October.</p>

<p>The rains are erratic, there being sometimes a drought and
sometimes too much rain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Products.</span>Dura, maize, semsem,
ground nuts, beans, and fish. A small quantity of ivory. Salt from
the left bank. Ostrich feathers from the Latuka. (N.B.—According to
recent game regulations, it is forbidden to buy feathers unless it
can be shown that they were pulled from a tame bird.)</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cattle.</span>In the Nile province
generally, the goats and sheep are small (much smaller than those
of the Sudan), and have little to recommend them. The cattle (the
few that are left) are also small, but are good milkers on the
whole.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Game.</span>Elephant, hippopotami and
rhinoceros plentiful, especially the two former, a few zebras and
giraffe, hartebeeste (? Jackson’s), waterbuck, bush buck, cobus
Thomasi (Uganda cob), and dig-dig abound. Buffalo and warthog may
be met with. Lion, leopard, and wild cat are fairly plentiful.
(N.B.—During the dry weather months the game is found near the
river in quantities; when the grass is high and there is water
inland, it is not so easy to see much). Guinea fowl, greater and
lesser bustard, quail snipe, ducks, geese, and other waterfowl and
partridges are nearly always to be shot.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.—A small supply of food can usually
be supplied at each of the above camps, with the exception of the
Junction Camp. Water is obtainable at all camps. At many places
fish can be bought. Trade goods are brass, wire, small white beads,
candles, matches, bottles, and some cloth. Tarbushes are much
appreciated by the chiefs. Hippo. abound in the Nile, and elephants
between Nimule and Gondokoro. Lions are seen occasionally.</p>

<p class="space-above15">The following short account of the country
between Nimule and Gondokoro is given by Sir C. Eliot (July, 1902),
from <em>Geographical Journal</em>, December, 1902:—</p>

<p class="hang2">“Immediately after Nimule begin the rapids, which
render the river unnavigable up to Bedden, about 30 miles above
Gondokoro. This latter station and Nimule are connected by two
roads, neither of them good. One keeps close to the Nile, and was
impracticable when I made the journey, as it was under water owing
to recent rains;<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the other runs further inland. It cannot
be said to offer adequate means for communicating between two
Government stations, or for the transport of any sort of goods. For
a great part of its course is obstructed by marshes, thorn bushes,
or grass 6 feet high; but here and there it passes through pleasant
open meadows, studded with large trees. Part of it consists of
precipitous paths cut in the rock, and it is crossed by many
rivers, at least three of which, the Assua, the Karpata (?), and
the Kit (or Kiti), present serious obstacles to foot passengers
when in flood, as I found them. The first is crossed on rafts made
of ambach, a very light wood. The natives show considerable skill
in guiding these rafts across the torrent, but the passenger or
load is generally half submerged. The two other rivers have to be
crossed by wading, and are about 4 feet deep. The Kit was about 150
yards wide. The whole journey took me 7 days, that is to say, 6
night camps. The distance is between 110 and 120 miles.”</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span><a id=
"route140"></a>140.—ROADS <span class="sc">in the</span> LADO
ENCLAVE.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Roads.</span>A road runs from Kiro to
Rejaf direct, at some distance from the river bank, with a branch
road to Lado.</p>

<p>The road from Rejaf as far as Faraji—170 miles to the S.W.—is
about the same width as a good English high road. It has many
bridges over streams, small khors, &amp;c. They are made of wood
and are not at all strong. There is a project to run
automobiles<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class=
"fnanchor">[54]</a> over this road, but the bridges are not at
present (June, 1903) strong enough. One automobile will probably
run between Rejaf and Yei station (94 miles), and another from Yei
to Dongu (62 miles), as there is no bridge over the Yei. The Yei
and Dongu are 40 to 60 yards broad and very deep during the
rains.</p>

<p>There are some parts of the road which are worse than others,
and it is proposed to have small stations at which bullocks will be
kept in order to pull the automobiles over them.</p>

<p>There are rest-house stations every two or three hours the whole
way from Rejaf to Dongu and Ibembo (<em>v.</em> below). At each of
these stations there are houses for Europeans, and at a great
number of them bananas, pawpaws, fowls, eggs, &amp;c., are now
obtainable.</p>

<p>Vegetables, bananas, &amp;c., are being planted at all the
stations.</p>

<p>Each station is in charge of one or more soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Loka or Loki.</span>Loka (called also
Gumbiri).—Four days (62 miles) from Rejaf. A white officer in
charge, and one or two N.C.O.’s. Surrounded by a wooden stockade.
About six good brick buildings with grass roofs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Yei.</span>Yei.—Close to the Nile-Congo
watershed. Two days (37 miles) from Gumbiri. Large fortified
station, but not yet completed, situated on high ground, from which
good view of the surrounding country is obtained. A far larger
station than Lado. About ten white officers and a doctor. None of
the Belgian Nile stations in any way compare with this one. All
white men’s houses are outside the fortifications. About 12 good
brick buildings with grass roofs; very healthy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Aba.</span>Aba.—Three days (32 miles)
from Yei. Wooden stockade. Four brick houses and a large one being
built for the Commandant. The latter outside stockade. One white
officer and one N.C.O.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Faraji.</span>Faraji.—Four days (38
miles) from Aba, on left bank of River Dongu. Brick wall about 6
feet high. Ditch outside; earth from ditch thrown up against the
wall. Good brick buildings. Three white officers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dongu, &amp;c.</span>Dongu.—Five or six
days from Faraji; at junction of Rivers Dongu and Kibali. Brick
buildings.</p>

<p>Stations beyond Dongu, towards the Congo, on the automobile
road, are:—</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Niangara.</li>

<li>Surunga.</li>

<li>Amadi.</li>

<li>Bomokandi.</li>

<li>Mbima.</li>

<li>Buta.</li>

<li>Ibembo.</li>
</ul>

<p>A road also leads from Mbima to Jabbir and Gembele.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Bofaki.</span>Bofaki, or Wando.—Important
post, and garrison. Healthy. Large rubber and coffee
plantations.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Rejaf.</span>Rejaf: on the Nile.—Small
post. Bullock carts take 20 days along the sandy road from Yei;
usual time 7 days by march route.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dufile.</span>Dufile.—Small post. There
is a railway-track ready made from here to Stanleyville on the
Congo; not ready for traffic yet.</p>

<p>At all the posts mentioned there are cattle, fowls, bananas,
vegetables, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mails leave Lado for Ibembo on the 1st and 15th of every
month.</p>

<p>From Rejaf a road is being made to New Dufile, thence to Mahaji.
This road is joined at Kaji Kaji, about 60 miles S. of Rejaf, by a
road from Loka.</p>

<p>From Yei a road runs down the Yei River to Amadi.</p>
